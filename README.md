# pictureSorter
Python script to sort pictures (and virtually any file) years by years

How it works:

  -Run it and head into the config, then set the input folder (where your files are), and the output directory (where 2020, 2021... folders will be created).
  
  -Choose wether or not to handle folder (if true, the script will go inside any folder and pick it's content instead of copying it)
  
  -Go back and run it
